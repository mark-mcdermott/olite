# LLM Documentation Migration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to adapt the LLM documentation from a Rails/Vue.js web app (Doximity) to the Xun Electron desktop app.

## Files Updated

### Context Files (`.llm/llm/context/`)
- ✅ **xun-overview.md** - NEW: Comprehensive overview of Xun's vision and features
- ✅ **technology-stack.md** - Updated for Electron/Node/Vite/React stack
- ✅ **project-structure.md** - Updated for Electron app structure (main/renderer/preload)
- ✅ **coding-patterns.md** - Updated for React/Electron patterns (IPC, hooks, tag system)
- ✅ **testing-strategy.md** - Updated for Electron testing (Vitest + Playwright)
- ✅ **development-commands.md** - Updated for Electron development workflows
- ✅ **web-access.md** - Updated for Electron app access (no web URLs)
- ❌ **api-conventions.md** - DELETED (no REST API in desktop app)

### Rules Files (`.llm/llm/rules/`)
- ✅ **javascript.md** - Complete rewrite for TypeScript/React/Electron patterns
- ✅ **architecture.md** - Updated to remove Rails patterns, add Electron architecture
- ❌ **rails.md** - DELETED (no Ruby/Rails in this project)
- ✅ **testing.md** - Kept (general testing principles still apply)
- ✅ **documentation.md** - Kept (general documentation principles still apply)

### Root Context
- ✅ **root-context.md** - Updated project description and removed Rails references
- ✅ **CLAUDE.md** - Symlink created for Claude Code
- ✅ **AGENTS.md** - Symlink created for GitHub Copilot

### Agents Deleted (`.llm/llm/agents/`)
- ❌ **dhh.md** - DELETED (Rails-specific agent)
- ❌ **deployment-coordinator.md** - DELETED (no web deployment)
- ❌ **integration-tester.md** - DELETED (Rails-specific)
- ❌ **test-writer-ruby.md** - DELETED (no Ruby)
- ✅ **test-writer-javascript.md** - KEPT
- ✅ **application-architect.md** - KEPT
- ✅ **code-documentation-writer.md** - KEPT
- ✅ **code-quality-enforcer.md** - KEPT
- ✅ **feature-implementer.md** - KEPT

### Commands Deleted (`.llm/llm/commands/`)
- ❌ **dhh.md** - DELETED (Rails-specific)
- ❌ **qtest-ruby.md** - DELETED (no Ruby)
- ❌ **qux.md** - DELETED (UX testing command, not needed yet)
- ✅ All other commands kept (qnew, qcode, qcheck, qtest-js, etc.)

### Workflows Deleted (`.llm/llm/workflows/`)
- ❌ **test-writing.md** - DELETED (Ruby-specific)
- ❌ **ux-testing.md** - DELETED (not needed yet)
- ❌ **validation-md-js.md** - DELETED (project-specific to old codebase)
- ✅ All other workflows kept

## Key Changes

### Technology Stack
**Before:**
- Ruby on Rails backend
- Vue.js 3 frontend
- Inertia.js for server-driven UI
- PostgreSQL database
- Deployed to web servers

**After:**
- Electron desktop app
- React renderer process
- Node.js main process
- Local file system (markdown files)
- macOS app bundle

### Architecture Patterns
**Before:**
- Service objects (Rails pattern)
- ActiveRecord models
- Inertia controllers
- Vue 3 Composition API

**After:**
- Electron IPC communication
- React hooks and context
- File system operations
- Pure functions and utilities

### Testing Strategy
**Before:**
- RSpec for Ruby tests
- Vitest for JavaScript
- Capybara for system tests

**After:**
- Vitest for unit/component tests
- Playwright for E2E Electron tests
- Mock IPC and file system

## What Stayed the Same

- General architecture principles (SOLID, composition over inheritance)
- Function quality checklist
- Testing best practices (behavior over implementation)
- Code organization philosophy (feature-based, DRY)
- Documentation structure (context → rules → workflows → commands)

## Next Steps

Now that the LLM documentation is updated, the next phase is to:
1. Set up the Electron + Vite + React project structure
2. Implement vault and file system operations
3. Build the markdown editor and tag system
4. Create the UI (sidebar, tabs, breadcrumbs)
5. Add publishing integration
6. Polish and optimize

## Notes for Future AI Assistants

When working on Xun:
1. Always read `.llm/llm/context/xun-overview.md` first
2. Follow Electron security best practices (context isolation, no nodeIntegration)
3. All file operations happen in main process via IPC
4. Use TypeScript with strict mode
5. Test with Playwright for E2E, Vitest for units
6. This is a personal tool - optimize for simplicity, not generality
