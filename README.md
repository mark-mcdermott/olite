# Xun

> A lightweight desktop note-taking app for macOS, inspired by Obsidian.

## What is Xun?

Xun is a streamlined note-taking and journaling application designed for a specific workflow:
- Daily notes with automatic date-based creation
- Tag-based content organization (`#project-a`, `#personal`, etc.)
- Auto-generated tag views that aggregate all content by tag
- Integrated blog publishing to GitHub/Vercel
- Clean, Obsidian-inspired UI with split panes and tabs

This is a personal tool built for a single user, focusing on simplicity and maintainability.

## Features

### Core Features
- Daily notes (auto-created with YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Tag-based content sections (delimited by `---`)
- Tag views (read-only aggregated content pages)
- File tree sidebar with right-click context menus
- Markdown editor with live rendering
- Split pane support for viewing multiple notes

### Publishing System
- Publish tagged content to multiple blog targets
- GitHub integration for commits and deploys
- Progress tracking for async publish operations
- Support for Astro, Next.js, and other static sites on Vercel

### Future Features
- Custom emoji support
- Content deletion by tag (for job separation)
