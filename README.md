# Xun Notes

> A lightweight desktop app for note-taking and blog publishing, inspired by Obsidian.

## What is Xun Notes?

A small Electron app that looks like Obsidian and has core note-taking functionality, without all the extra stuff Obsidian has. And it has a few nice extra features.

## Special Features

- A quick publish to blog post feature (for static site blogs with GitHub repos where the site is on Cloudflare Pages):
  - Even if you mix everything into daily notes, you can still quickly make a blog post in the middle and publish just the post, without publishing the rest of the note.
  - Can handle multiple blogs and let's you select which blog you want to publish each post to.
  - Shows a nice progress bar and publish status so you know if the build is still running and if it succeeds or not.
- A delete all content under a single tag feature
  - You can mix all your work and personal notes into daily notes using tags to track of the different content types.l
  - You can later easily delete all content from one tag. Handy if you ever leave your current job and need to quickly delete all work notes without losing any of your personal notes.

### Core Note Taking Features

- Daily notes (auto-created with YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Optional tag-based content blocks (opened by `#<topic>`, closed by `---`)
- Tag views (both editable and read-only aggregated views of all content under a tag)
- File tree sidebar
- Markdown editor with live rendering
- Split pane support for editing and previewing markdown at the same time

### Possible Future Features

- Custom emoji support
- More CMS feautres like list all posts and post edit/delete functionality
- Smoother UX with micro-interaction focus

## AI Assistant Integration

This project includes LLM documentation in `.llm/` for AI coding assistants like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor.

Entry points (symlinks):

- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code
- `AGENTS.md` - GitHub Copilot

These files provide context about the project architecture, coding standards, and development workflows.

## Dev Process

I vibe coded this in Claude Code in about a week's worth of evenings/weekends, using the Playwright MPC server to have Claude check its own work. Then I went back and reviewed everything line by line and researched the parts I didn't understand.

## License

Private project - not open source.

## Status

Currently in a beta release phase. I want the UX "micro-interactions" to be cleaner before proper release.
